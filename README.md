## AIM:
To write a python program for getting the word count from the contents of a file using command line arguments.
## EQUIPEMENT'S REQUIRED: 
PC
Anaconda - Python 3.7
## ALGORITHM: 
### Step 1:
Import the sys module.
## Step 2:
Pass the filename as the first argument after the name of script. Open the file as sys.argv[1]
## Step 3:
Read the file using read() method.
## Step 4:
Use split() method to split the file content into words.
## Step 5:
Use len() to find the total words.
## Step 6:
Run the program to determine the number of words in the file created.
## PROGRAM:
'''

fname=input("enter the file name")

num_words=0

with open(fname, 'r') as f:

   for line in f:

      words=line.split()

num_words+=len (words)

print('Number of words:Â ',num_words)
